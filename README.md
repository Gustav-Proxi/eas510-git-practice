# My AI Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome to my repository!  
This space documents my journey in **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning** — from the very first steps of coding to building real-world projects.

## 🌱 How It Started
My curiosity for AI began back in high school, when I taught myself the basics of programming through YouTube. Inspired by technology (and yes, Iron Man played a role 😅), I pursued a **B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering with a specialization in AI & ML** at Presidency University, Bangalore.  

## 📚 Academic Milestones
- Completed my undergraduate degree in 2024 with projects in **computer vision, GANs, and NLP**.  
- Published research in AI and multi-agent systems.  
- Currently pursuing my **Master’s in Artificial Intelligence (specializing in Machine Learning & Data Science)**, exploring advanced topics like LLMs, generative AI, and reinforcement learning.  

## 💻 Projects That Shaped My Learning
- **AI-DxMH:** AI-powered mental health diagnosis support tool  
- **Car Counter (OpenCV):** Real-time vehicle detection & counting  
- **GANs for Image Realism:** Enhancing low-quality images  
- **Simple CNN:** Learning the foundations of deep learning  

## 🛠️ Skills Acquired
- **Programming:** Python, C, Java, R  
- **AI/ML Frameworks:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn  
- **Specializations:** NLP, Computer Vision, LLMs, Generative AI  
- **Cloud:** AWS Academy Cloud Foundations  

## 🎯 What’s Next
- Building expertise in **data-intensive computing and scalable AI systems**  
- Developing **AI-first solutions in healthcare**  
- Contributing more to **open-source projects**
